              We have letters of supports from many Miami Dade Schools. These
              letters and commendations show our path and hard-work, but most
              importantly, the community’s satisfaction. By bringing art
              Exhibitions & art workshops to all ages, from the youngsters with
              their rich imaginations to the senior citizens with their wisdom
              and life long experiences, we have successfully accomplished all
              our goals.
